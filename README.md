This project focuses on performance modeling of linear solvers from PETSc with TAU and jumpshot tools.
Phase 1: Perform modeling for Wave2d example.
Phase 1 steps: 
1. Export appropritae TAU makefile.
2. Compile code with TAU(used taucc).
3. Generate SLOG2 file from TAU.
4. Get jumpshot. 
5. Visualize the SLOG2 file with jumpshot.
Phase 1 completed on: March 10, 2017 @3:42 pm. 
Script: Phase1_script.sh
Visualization results: Visualize_wave2d.jpg/png/jpeg
Phase 2: Perform modeling for PETSc KSP/KSP/ex5 with no preconditioner.
